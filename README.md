# SmartEnergyMeter
Final Year Project

Single setup system to track complete power consumption. The system we propose allows real-time power monitoring and insight suggestions that help reduce power loads and electricity bills.
The system consists of 4 units:
- the hardware module which connects to an existing electrical distribution board
- Cloud data storage and hosted ML pipelines
- Real-time data and insight report tool for end users
- Front End Flutter 2 PWA/App

We monitor power signatures and loads in real time to analyse, report and ascertain expected device loads and measures to reduce them. Our system allows:
- End users to have active control over their power usage with suggestions on how to reduce them
- Electricity providers to have active access to real time consumption data and trends based on localities

#Application and use-cases:
- Geo-power distribution mapping for Electricity boards
- Outages monitoring for quick turnaround time
- Analytics to reduce carbon footprint
- Identify power leakages
- Variable rate tariff balancing
