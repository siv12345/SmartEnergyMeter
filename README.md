# SmartEnergyMeter
Final Year Project

Single setup system to track complete power consumption. The system we propose allows real-time power monitoring and insight suggestions that help reduce power loads and electricity bills.
The system consists of 4 units:
- the hardware module which connects to an existing electrical distribution board
- Cloud data storage and hosted ML pipelines
- Real-time data and insight report tool for end users
- Front End Flutter 2 PWA/App

We monitor power signatures and loads in real time to analyse, report and ascertain expected device loads and measures to reduce them. Our system allows:
- End users to have active control over their power usage with suggestions on how to reduce them
- Electricity providers to have active access to real time consumption data and trends based on localities

## Application and use-cases:
- Geo-power distribution mapping for Electricity boards
- Outages monitoring for quick turnaround time
- Analytics to reduce carbon footprint
- Identify power leakages
- Variable rate tariff balancing

### Usecase

Here we came across a good usecase scenario for out project where a user can be notified about an impending overload.

The user has a window of opportunity to turn off appliances that are consuming too much power. The circuit breaker trips or the fuse burns out.

The dashboard shows that we have crossed the limit for this household.
